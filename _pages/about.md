I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**.  
My research focuses on **microeconomic theory**, especially **epistemic game theory**, **strategic reasoning**, and **rationalizability in finite models**.  
I am broadly interested in how players form beliefs about others’ rationality and how such beliefs shape equilibrium behavior in dynamic and networked environments.

### 📑 Working Papers

**Rational Strategic Behavior in Finite Models**  
This paper studies how rational behavior can be represented by *finite type structures* even in complex finite games.  
We show that for any finite game, there exists a finite-richness model generating the same rationalizable strategies as the analytical one.  
The Iterated Elimination of Never Best Responses (IENBR) and rationalizability procedures can be implemented by finite type structures.

**Backward Induction: A Characterization**  
We provide a foundation for backward induction via **Common Knowledge of Future Rationality (CKFR)**.  
The paper shows that CKFR implies subgame rationalizability in dynamic games and yields the backward induction outcome in perfect-information games.  
An iterative procedure is proposed to characterize subgame rationalizability and demonstrate order independence.

**Peer-Confirming Equilibrium with Multiple Networks**  
Extending Lipnowski and Sadler (2019), this paper introduces *two layers of networks* — one for strategy knowledge and one for rationality knowledge.  
A peer-confirming equilibrium requires players to best respond to beliefs consistent with both, correctly predict neighbors’ actions, and treat trusted peers as rational.  
This framework provides a flexible language for modeling social and informational interdependence.
